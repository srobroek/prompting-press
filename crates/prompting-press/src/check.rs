//! Advisory lint types and shared helpers for the agreement + trusted/guard check
//! (spec 008 reshape; FR-016..020).
//!
//! Post-reshape, the lint runs **per-`Prompt`** via [`Prompt::check`](crate::Prompt::check),
//! not over a registry. Construction enforces the **hard** invariants (template parseable,
//! referenced roots ⊆ declared variables, no reserved variant name). The only LIVE finding
//! `Prompt::check()` can surface is the advisory:
//!
//! 1. **Trust / guard advisory (FR-018, reframed).** A `Prompt` that declares one or more
//!    `trusted: false` variables but carries no `"guard"` key in its `metadata`
//!    map → [`FindingKind::UntrustedWithoutGuard`] per uncovered field.
//!
//! `UntrustedWithoutGuard` is the only `FindingKind` variant; the hard invariants (undeclared
//! variables, analysis errors, reserved variant names) are enforced at construction and never
//! appear in a `CheckReport` from a live `Prompt`.
//!
//! ## The `metadata.guard` convention (C-09)
//!
//! A prompt has a guard configured iff a `"guard"` key is present in its `metadata` map.
//! The map is a library-opaque `serde_json::Map`; this module reads it
//! **read-only** and checks only for the *presence* of the top-level key — not its shape.
//!
//! ## Purity (FR-019)
//!
//! [`Prompt::check`](crate::Prompt::check) takes `&self`, never renders, never mutates.
//! Its only output is a [`CheckReport`].
